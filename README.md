This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### MVP: The user should be able to enter their bill in an input and select the percentage of tip from a dropdown .

When they press the calculate button, the tip and total bill (with tip) amount will show.

### Bronze: Validate inputs and show messages if the inputs are incorrect.

This section has moved here: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment

### Silver: Add the ability to split the bill in your dinner party. 

Did not format inputs with Cleave.js. 
Included custome checks and basic JS methods.
